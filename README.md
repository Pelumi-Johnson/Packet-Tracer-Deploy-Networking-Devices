## 📘 Project Summary
This project demonstrates foundational network engineering skills by deploying and organizing multiple Cisco routers inside a virtual topology using Cisco Packet Tracer. I practiced accurate device placement, rapid duplication, and logical layout organization essential skills for IT support, networking, and cybersecurity roles where engineers design, scale, and troubleshoot real-world network infrastructures. This project directly reflects tasks performed in professional environments, such as staging equipment, preparing diagrams, and building clean topologies.

## 🎯 Skills Demonstrated
- Accurate device selection and placement in the Logical workspace  
- Efficient deployment of identical devices (CTRL-click method)  
- Bulk duplication using SHIFT selection  
- Understanding Cisco router families (2911, 1941, 4331, 4321)  
- Maintaining a clean, organized network layout  
- Preparing topologies for future configuration and scaling

## 🧰 Tools & Environment
- **Platform:** Cisco Packet Tracer  
- **Workspace:** Logical view  
- **Router Models Used:**  
  - Cisco 2911  
  - Cisco 1941  
  - Cisco 4331  
  - Cisco 4321

## 🔧 Project Steps

### **1. Deploying Initial Devices**
I began by placing three different router models into the workspace:
- 2911 above *Router0*
- 1941 above *Router1*
- 4331 above *Router2*

This strengthened accuracy when selecting and positioning devices.  


---

### **2. Rapid Deployment of Identical Devices**
Next, I deployed several Cisco 4321 routers quickly using the **CTRL-click rapid placement method**, placing them above *Router3*, *Router4*, and *Router5*.  
This technique is essential when building larger topologies that require many identical devices.  


---

### **3. Copying Existing Devices**
I practiced duplicating routers already in the workspace by:
- Highlighting *Router3*,  
- Holding **CTRL** and dragging to create a clone,  
- Using **SHIFT** to select and duplicate multiple routers simultaneously.

This reflects real tasks such as scaling environments, redesigning topology layouts, or staging configurations for testing.

## 📝 Lessons Learned
- Improved accuracy when placing and arranging routers  
- Learned efficient device duplication techniques  
- Strengthened Packet Tracer navigation and workspace control  
- Gained experience with multiple Cisco router models  
- Built confidence designing clean, organized network layouts suitable for professional environments
